# OokamiKunTV LANjoiner

LANjoiner is a Windows PowerShell script made by Franz "OokamiKunTV" to ease the process of setting up and play custom Rocket League
maps and gamemodes with other people from my community.

This script has the capabilities of installing the following software:
ZeroTier One, a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) tool, similar to Hamachi
BakkesMod, a must-have modding platform for Rocket League
Custom Map Loader, a tool for loading custom maps into Rocket League (replaces the "Underpass" map)

Additionally, this script can also install several additional components, such as "RocketPlugin",
which is a BakkesMod plugin that enables multiplayer functionality on custom maps.
It may also install other optional components, such as nice-to-have BakkesMod plugins and custom maps.

# DISCLAIMER  
Many are sceptical of running scripts on their computers (for good reason), but this script contains no malicius code.
However, if you'd like to look into how this script works, you are free to do so, I've commented most of the script.
With that said, there may be the occational bug or unintended behaviour, so this script is provided with no guarantee,
and you execute this script at your own risk.
Also, most (if not all) maps listed in our "Maps.txt" file is made by other creators, who are credited after the map name. Show them some love if you like theyr maps!
I encourage everyone using my script to report any bugs, errors, etc to me on Discord!
You can create a thread in the Discord Channel "#community-dev" (https://discord.com/channels/896713616089309184/1037449432079290368)
